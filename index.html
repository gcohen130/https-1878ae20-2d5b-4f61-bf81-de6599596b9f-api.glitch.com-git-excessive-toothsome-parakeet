              It would be easy for Tommy and Virginia Rosa to chalk up their
              story as one of loss. High school sweethearts separated by a
              family move, Tommy wrongfully convicted of homicide at 27, it
              wasn’t until nearly three decades into his sentence that they
              found each other again—and eight more years after that until he
              was released. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="2">
            <p>
              While serving time for a crime he did not commit,
              Tommy lost his mother, brother, aunt, and oldest child to cancer
              at 21 years-old. But when they tell their story what they keep
              returning to is hope, faith, and family.

              They talk of support—supporting one another, support from friends
              and kin, but also the support they were able to lend others.
              Whether it was one of the nine wrongfully convicted persons Tommy
              helped get out or the inexperienced visitors who needed advice,
              instruction, or a different blouse to wear.

          <div class="step" data-step="4">
            <p>
              In prison, Tommy didn’t care for therapists. If he was going to
              confide in anyone it would be the deacon, who knew how to talk to
              Tommy. Yet with a future full of only possibility, Tommy wants to
              be a counselor. With a nervous smile—half-toothless from cancer in
              his jaw—he says, “no one can tell me I can’t imagine what they’ve
              been through. If they’ve been through it, so have I.”
              (Paraphrasing—might be better served as a video clip) But instead
              of getting angry or frustrated or sour, Tommy wants to turn that
              pain into hope for others.
            </p>

          <div class="step" data-step="5">
            <p>
              As Tommy and Virginia wait for his exoneration to come through,
              they can’t help but dream of the places they want to travel, the
              people they want to see, and the food they want to eat. Thye have
              family in Pennsylvania, Missouri and Puerto Rico. Virginia, who
              has taken up painting over the past two years, wants to go to
              Spain, France and Italy. Tommy just wants to be able to take in a
              game with his son—it doesn’t matter if it’s the Sox, Pats, or
              Bruins, he is a fan of it all. Virginia gives him a nudging elbow
              to the ribs, “maybe dinner and play.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="6">
            <p>
              Tommy jokes that sometimes Virginia loves him a little too
              much—he’s not a snuggler—but one can tell that she is at the core
              of everything important to him in his new life of freedom. They
              are a team, they are partners, and they would not be where they
              are today without the other. For what is family if not unbridled
              love, hope, and faith in each other.
